## Inspiration
After spending years trying to learn new languages through online learning platforms such as Duolingo, we agreed that there was a massive gap in the market for apps that allowed intermediate users to practice dialogue in relevant context. 

## What it does
It provides users the opportunity to immerse themselves into a the country in which their desired language is spoken, and learn through dialogue. They are able to converse with people they may run into while exploring the city and gain lots of practice with verbal communication.

## How we built it
This mobile application was built using Figma. The idea itself is quite complex in nature, and it would not have been feasible to build the mobile application from scratch especially considering there are portions that required machine learning. 

## Challenges we ran into
We found it difficult to create the business model as it was hard to determine how pricing would work in a way that would be beneficial to us and the user. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of creating the Figma as it really brought our idea to life and is extremely close to what we initially envisioned.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about the necessary business and economic knowledge that is needed to launch a mobile application. We were also able to learn more about web development and voice recognition technologies. Additionally, we gained more experience using Figma. Finally, as a team of first-time hackers, we had a memorable first Hackathon experience.

## What's next for TravelVerse
In the future, we'd like to be able to implement features that enable the application to recognise errors in tone, volume, and pronunciation. We also hope to continue to expand the simulation by accepting user feedback and using it as a basis for future iterations.
